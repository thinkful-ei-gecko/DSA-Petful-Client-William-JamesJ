## Summary

Petful is an app designed to match pets with their forever homes. Users simply access the adoption portal, confirm their registration information (name and password) and are prompted where they are in line, or if they are now eligible to adopt the next pet! Once a user's turn arrives, simply choose from among the available pets and that's it - you will be giving a loving companion its forever home.
